Standard operating procedures (SPO) for university pedagogical coaching

This document was originally written for a teaching and learning center at a university in Seoul, Korea. I once worked there, but left long ago; I have recently revised it in order to make it publicly available. 

This focuses on standard procedures for pedagogical coaching of new professors at a university, and is intented for educational consultants (especially new ones) engaged in coaching new faculty members. 

This document categorizes issues that commonly arise in pedagogical coaching, especially in a university EMI context. Some remediations or solutions are briefly discussed, and links to relevant sources for more information and ideas are provided for new educational consultants. This classification is also the basis for a research study that I conducted based on my coaching sessions: 

![Lee&Lee2023](Faculty.coaching.2023.pdf) Lee, K. A., & Lee, H. (2023). Faculty coaching and faculty needs in Korean universities. Journal of Pan-Pacific Association of Applied Linguistics, 27(2), 27-52.)  

This also focused on needs of professors in an English-medium instruction (EMI) context, whereby many new professors in various departments may be required to teach courses in English. 

The SOP document in this directory consists of the following sections. 

1. Introduction
2. Coaching process
3. Typical coaching issues
   a. Pedagogical issues
   b. General remediation strategies
