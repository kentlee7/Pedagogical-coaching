Standard operating procedures (SPO) for university pedagogical coaching

This document was originally written for a teaching and learning center at a university in Seoul, Korea. I once worked there, but left long ago; I have recently revised it in order to make it publicly available. 

This focuses on standard procedures for pedagogical coaching of new professors at a university, and is intented for educational consultants (especially new ones) engaged in coaching new faculty members. 

This document categorizes issues that commonly arise in pedagogical coaching, especially in a university EMI context. Some remediations or solutions are briefly discussed, and links to relevant sources for more information and ideas are provided for new educational consultants. 

This also focused on needs of professors in an English-medium instruction (EMI) context, whereby many new professors in various departments may be required to teach courses in English. 

## Research basis 
This classification derives from, and serves as the basis for a research study that I conducted based on my coaching sessions: 

![Lee&Lee2023](Faculty.coaching.2023.pdf) Lee, K. A., & Lee, H. (2023). Faculty coaching and faculty needs in Korean universities. Journal of Pan-Pacific Association of Applied Linguistics, 27(2), 27-52.)

## Teaching philosophy 
Finally, this repository also containts a guidebook on teaching philosophies, which educational consultants can use for workshops and for one-on-one coaching with professors, to help them explorea and understand their teaching philosophies. Instructors' teaching philsophies may be implicit and hard to introspect about. Instructors might identify with a particular set of teaching values that they find appealing, but their actual teaching practice might diverge greatly from those explicit values that they would declar. In spite of values or teaching beliefs they may consciously identify with, many instructors fall back on practices that they are familiar with, e.g., how they learned when they were students. Educational consultants can use guides like this to explore and reflect on actual teaching beliefs and practices. This can also be helpful for those who need to submit teaching philosophy statements, e.g., for job applications.
